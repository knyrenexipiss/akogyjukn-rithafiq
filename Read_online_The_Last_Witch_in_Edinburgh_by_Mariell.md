Overview
For fans of Sarah Penner‚Äôs The Lost Apothecary and Alix E. Harrow‚Äôs The Once and Future Witches, this lush, atmospheric novel from the author of Where Ivy Dares to Grow blends witchcraft, queer love, a vibrant Edinburgh setting, and Scottish folklore for a propulsive and emotional story exploring what it means to resist the patriarchy and find your voice.
 
 ‚ÄúA lyrical and hauntingly beautiful new voice.‚Äù ‚ÄîHester Fox, Author of A Lullaby for Witches
 
 In an alternate Edinburgh of 1824, every woman lives in fear that she will be the next one hanged for witchcraft. All it takes is invoking the anger, or the desire, of the wrong person. Nellie Duncan, beautiful and unwed, keeps to herself until she encounters the Rae Women‚Äôs Apothecary. There, fiery Jean Rae and the other women provide cures and teach others that they too can aid the winter deity, the Cailleach, embracing her characteristic independence, agency, and craft, in turn becoming witches themselves.
 
 Nellie finds a place and a purpose at the shop, and a blossoming romance with Jean, as she learns about nature-based craft and a witch‚Äôs ability to return to life after death. But the Cailleach has an ancient enemy intent on stripping the power of the deity and all her witches, leaving a wake of patriarchal violence and destruction. When heart-breaking disaster strikes, Nellie flees and spends the next two centuries hiding from the world‚Äîuntil love gives her the courage and the motivation to come back.
 
 Nellie‚Äôs past is waiting for her there, and hanging witches is no longer the only means of oppression. But this time, Nellie refuses to run‚Äîeither from her foes, or from her resolve to awaken others to the unimaginable power that can come with fighting the patriarchy in its many forms‚Äîand finding one‚Äôs own magical inner-strength.
