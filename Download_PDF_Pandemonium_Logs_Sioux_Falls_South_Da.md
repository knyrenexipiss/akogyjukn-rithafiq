Overview
In 2015, Ben Miller andÂ the poet Anne Pierson Wiese moved from New York City to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to explore their midwestern roots and to focus on their writing careers. Working a day job in a hospital, Miller had a front-row seat to the COVID-19 pandemic as it moved from the coasts to the urban Midwest. Pandemonium Logs casts an unflinching eye on the state of the worker in the US health-care system during a global pandemic, giving voice to the doctors, nurses, support staff, patients, and families caught in the complex swirl of daily dilemmas and crucial choices. In unsparing yet sympathetic prose, Ben Miller creates an intimate portrait of the impact of COVID on the diverse people of South Dakota. Through a wide range of charactersâ€”from understandably confused patients to quietly competent nursesâ€”he explores the human complexities of the crisis: aÂ doctor based in Mumbai who treats critically ill patients in the Dakotas via a tenuous hodgepodge of telehealth apparatus, aÂ Hydra of six workplace trainers who together cannot train one employee to do one job, aÂ vice president of corporate hospitality who lives to rip down safety signs as fast as nurses post them, aÂ ninety-year-old hospital volunteer who pushes wheelchairs containing patients half his age. In Pandemonium Logs, Miller providesÂ precise and moving observations of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
