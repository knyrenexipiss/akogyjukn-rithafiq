Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Olympus isn&#039;t big enough for both of them. A goddess relegated to domesticity, her husband set on becoming a tyrannical ruler â€” this is Hera like we&#039;ve never known her before. In this enthralling retelling from the #1 internationally bestselling author of Ariadne, Elektra, and Atalanta, Greek mythologyâ€™s most famous and maligned goddess finally tells her own story, as power, passion, and divine strength collide in the heart of Olympus
 
 Even the gods must have their queen. When the immortal goddess Hera and her brother Zeus overthrow their tyrannical father, she dreams of ruling at Zeus&#039;s side. But as they establish their reign on Mount Olympus, Hera begins to see that Zeus is just as ruthless and cruel as the father they betrayed. While Zeus ascends, Hera is relegated to the role of wife and mother, a role she never wanted. She was always born to rule, but must she lose herself in perpetuating this cycle of violence and cruelty? Or can she find a way to forge a better world?
