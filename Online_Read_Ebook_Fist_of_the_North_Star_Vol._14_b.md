Overview
In the original classic manga set in a postapocalyptic wasteland ruled by savage gangs, a hero appears to bring justice to the guilty. This warrior named Ken holds the deadly secrets of a mysterious martial art known as Hokuto Shinkenâ€”the Divine Fist of the North Star!
 
 In a postapocalyptic world, humanity has risen from the ashes of all-out nuclear war to a nightmare of endless suffering. It is a time of chaos. Warlords and gangs of savage marauders rule the broken ruins of civilization, terrorizing and enslaving the survivors. Life has become a brutal struggle for existence and death the only release.
 
 The arrival of Kenshiro in the land of the Asuras was preceded by the legend of Raoh, who it was said would bring justice to that blighted place. The people of the land of the Asuras suffer in the grip of its savage leaders, the dreaded Rasho, three masters of Hokuto Ryuken. Now, Kenshiro has come to rescue Rin and Shachi. To do it, heâ€™ll have to face the first Rasho, the demon lord Kaio, a man whose soul burns with the rage of the gods!
