 Jay Kristoff, SUNDAY TIMES bestselling author of NEVERNIGHT and EMPIRE OF THE VAMPIRE Anna survived the attempt to bind her magic, but Anna and her coven arenâ€™t free from danger yet. Haunted by her auntâ€™s death, living in fear of her curse, and fated to love the one man she can never have, the last thing Anna needs is a witch hunt. Now she must conceal her magic once more or risk losing everything. But when deadly hysteria strikes across the capital, and in her own school, the coven are left dangerously exposed.
