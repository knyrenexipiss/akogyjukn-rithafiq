#1 internationally bestselling author Sara Blaedel is back with a powerful and twist-filled new suspense novel featuring detective Louise Rick.
 
 Louise gets a call from her son, Jonas. It&amp;#039;s every parent&amp;#039;s worst nightmare: A school party has ended in terrifying chaos after a group of violent teenagers forced their way into the building in search of alcohol and valuables. Dashing to the scene, Louise discovers one of the students gravely injured--struck by a car while attempting to run for help. Now the girl&amp;#039;s distraught mother, pushed to her emotional breaking point, will do anything to make those who hurt her daughter pay.
 So when someone targets the gang members with a vicious attack, the girl&amp;#039;s mother is the obvious suspect. But Louise can&amp;#039;t shake the feeling that the case might not be as cut-and-dried as it first appears. Someone is lying--but who?
 Masterfully plumbing the darkest depths of human emotion in this propulsive new novel, Sara Blaedel again delivers an intense ride filled with unexpected turns that will have you on the edge of your seat...
